Akins ECHS,59.0,80.0,1,2,"Austin. The school’s purpose statement is to graduate all students prepared to be successful in it is assumed that the programs taught out of these portables do not meet current Ed Spec standards. The list of programs currently taught in portables is sign language, French, Spanish, students and holding these large classes in a portable studio is problematic. The athletic fields and track are on the other side of Old San Antonio Road. Traffic has increased exponentially on this road and creates safety concerns for students trying to cross. While it is in a school zone, cars are often driving far over the speed limit, and this was observed during the assessment walk. Interview Overview The administrators who attended the interview were Principal Salazar, Associate Principal Garcia and Management Assistant Senaida Martinez. The campus is a series of buildings creating a large central courtyard. The portables are located toward the back of the campus along Old San Antonio Road. The group indicated several programs are in portables, including the vet clinic and health science programs. The multilanguage studios are also in portables. The group indicated that the career and tech classes, greenhouse and barn are not in suitable spaces. The location of the track and soccer field across Old San Antonio Road is a concern. The group indicated there have been several pedestrian accidents. There are no protective lights for students to cross the street. There are inadequacies in the support buildings for the soccer field and track area. The baseball program has limited space and currently changes in regular restrooms. There is not enough space for PE. One of the academies is in the fine arts building. There is not adequate space for the piano program. The most needed spaces in fine arts according to the group are a larger dance studio, art rooms and drama studios. Only one of the drama teachers is in the fine arts building. The other two teach College High School Their wish list programs/spaces include welding, dentistry, fire academy, maker space, digital media (green screen room), recording studio and filmmaking lab. The fire academy is scheduled to become a program but will not have suitable space to use. The school has a recording studio, but it is makeshift and is championed by the teacher without additional district support. The group indicated the priority for them is to remove classes from the portables and said there is a need for large collaboration spaces for staff, students and the public.

Anderson High School,61.0,76.0,1,2,"including a T-STEM Academy (Texas Science, Technology, Engineering, Math). The T-STEM program participates in the national VEX Robotics Competition. The school also offers an The school has a large athletics department. The department has recurring scheduling issues with many of the athletics facilities, including the main gymnasium. The school is composed of multiple buildings, including the main three-story building that has openair hallways and courtyard spaces. The school was originally built as an open-concept plan. Since that time, many of the open classrooms (now studios) have been partitioned off, limiting space for flexible, collaborative zone. Many of the teaching spaces are within the core of the building and do not have access to daylight or views. The windows that are present in the school are small and let some natural light in, but do not provide extensive views to the outside. The main courtyard space adjacent to the cafeteria is a shaded courtyard with artificial turf. It is a nice, generous space and creates an excellent overflow area for cafeteria dining and is used by some studios, such as special education, almost every day. Interview Overview The interview was conducted on campus with Principal Harrison and Assistant Principal Nichols. Diane Newbury also joined to discuss facility conditions. She is responsible for putting in work orders for the campus. Anderson High School has an important historical legacy, and there are artifacts that the school would like to display from the original campus. They feel like they do not have an adequate way to display these artifacts, and this is one aspect of community importance that is lacking in the current campus. The trees throughout the campus should also be kept intact if additions happen. The interview highlighted many programs that are not in suitable spaces. The IB the program. As mentioned previously, athletics space is a large area of concern. Typical basketball and volleyball games turn away spectators due to lack of seating, many from visiting Radio/TV/film needs a more suitable space; they are housed in an old photography lab with Summary Report Anderson High School newscast. The graphic design program is in a space with no ceiling tiles and poor acoustics. Life skills has three studios, but only two have dedicated, accessible toilets. The school has a few CTE programs on its wish list. They would like an academic center for health science. They have interest in partnerships with area hospitals and would like to help students achieve certifications though clinical partnerships. Campus staff would like to start a cybersecurity program, but there is no space for it at this time. Staff indicated that the electrical system throughout the school does not allow for energy-intensive computers or servers to be installed. Current technology labs have daisy-chained equipment, have weak internet, and lack robust electrical wiring. They noted that many aspects of the school’s infrastructure, including lack of collaboration and flex spaces. For intermingling of the entire student enrollment. They do not physically separate AP/upper-level classes from on-grade classes, and they have programs for ninth graders that mix on-level and advanced courses. The school does not have collaboration spaces and there are no breakout spaces for group projects. They would also like teacher collaboration spaces (e.g., dedicated professional learning centers).

The school’s general appearance is not welcoming. Few windows can be seen from the street, resulting in a large expanse of brick. Existing windows are small and in some cases, not operational. Inside, two planted courtyards make the interior of the school feel more welcoming. The gym, cafeteria and library can all be used after-hours and secured from the rest allowed to eat anywhere on campus. The courtyards near the cafeteria have a good mix of multiple types of instructional technology, including TVs on rolling carts, projectors and projector screens. Typically, there is good power distribution along the walls of the studios, but no central charging towers or power outlets. The PTSA has recently purchased some charging towers for satisfactory. Outdoor learning takes place on the turf courtyard near the cafeteria. The area has some cover but little support for a true learning space; no power or screens are provided, and seating is not ideal for learning. The learning garden is small and in poor condition. No rain garden, rain collection cisterns, or nature trails are present on the campus. Furniture, Fixtures, much of it is not new. There is a good mix of furniture in the cafeteria, with options for indoor and outdoor dining. The library furniture is bulky and difficult to move, meaning the space is a large open space with high ceilings and several breakout rooms. It is large enough to create different zones for multiple groups but would be difficult to provide acoustical privacy. The space has numerous charging towers and seems to support technology well.

Austin High School,59.0,70.0,1,2,"Austin High uses the Academy Model to group students into four academies – Academy of Classical Studies, Design & Technology, Global Studies, and Science & Innovation. In order to create identities for these academies and have them be successful through collaboration and connection, multiple planning issues and concerns need to be addressed. Interview Overview The interview was completed with Principal Amy Taylor and addressed shortcomings and time was an open-concept floor plan. Since then, the school has been subdivided into individual studios, and now these insular spaces with no natural daylight do not match the concept and goals of the academies. Student group work rooms of varying sizes are desired along with added transparency from the studios. Each of the academies needs to function for its intended goals. For instance, Science & Innovation needs to have access to collaboration and maker the District’s Educational Specifications are embedded into the pillars of learning for the academies, and the current design (studios and support spaces) does not match that learning model. Some teachers take students to the nearby Austin Public Library to use the small group rooms, and the campus would like to have a similar resource – servable, technology-rich small and medium group rooms. Looking to the future, labs/maker spaces might need to function differently. They may not be tied directly to a studio or an instructor and might function more as a checkout resource. A music production studio, like the current film production studio, is also requested. There is a huge interest in music editing due to the connection to the Austin music scene. While a complete overhaul of the interior may not be possible, the principal did stress the importance of upgrading the furniture. Having furniture that is mobile, reconfigurable and wired High School A fine arts upgrade was discussed. There are not enough practice rooms or space. Guitar and jazz band are growing programs that need to be housed in more appropriate spaces. The band needs dressing rooms. They only have storage space to house instruments, which is inadequate. The black box theater is in adequate shape but needs a shop area. They construct everything on stage. The black box theater does not have access to restrooms. The principal believes the school’s location – which includes views of downtown – creates an opportunity to rent spaces out to the public or allow them to be used by students for events such as proms and other celebrations. Currently, most banquets/proms take place off campus at a cost burden to the students and PTA. There are some issues with the exterior/grounds of the building that were covered. The circulation of the circle drive to the front door is problematic with pedestrian traffic to the portables. General congestion in the area around Lady Bird Lake exacerbates problems for students, parents and buses getting in and out of campus. There are courses that use the lake as a resource, and current paths and sidewalks require students to walk out of their way. It is desired to rework walking paths to the lake and create a shortcut next to the track. To make more use of outdoor learning, creating an amphitheater for performances, speeches and lectures was mentioned. There are mature trees around the site, creating opportunities for shaded gathering spots. The trees are a source of pride for the campus and are taken care of by a former PTA member. Any future tree removal would be very problematic for the campus. places the campus in the Average category.

Bowie High School,62.0,65.0,1,1,"comprehensive high school in the district. Bowie High School is on a sprawling campus of for athletics, renovation for fine arts, a parking structure, and HVAC and technology average condition, but require upgrades to function adequately if implementing criteria from the current Ed Spec. The studio building is a large H-shape. The interior hallway is very wide with nice daylight but is not conditioned. It is very hot in the summer and cold in the winter. During high humidity events, the concrete floor sweats and creates slipping hazards. There is some flexible furniture within the space for students to meet and work, but it is underutilized due to the lack of weather control. At the center of the H-shape is the library. It is a large space with daylight coming from skylights. Every studio has access to daylight and generous windows to the exterior; however, all studios are undersized and have limited flexibility in providing different teaching methods. CTE programs are housed throughout the campus – some in the studio building and some in the current “art garage.” There is a robust agricultural program. The ag barn is adjacent to campus and is somewhat walkable, but if students are tending animals before or after school, they typically drive. The main campus courtyard between the studio/cafeteria/administration is a large space and has one of the premier live oak trees in Austin. The courtyard space is well-loved on campus, but shade is only provided by walkways and a few trees. Upgrades to furniture and landscaping could improve this space to be better utilized for outdoor learning and activities. Interview Overview The interview took place at Bowie High School. It included Principal Mark Robinson and Assistant Principal Stephanie McGraw in person and a group of personnel, teachers and a CTE instructor joining by phone. After the interview, Principal Robinson walked the assessment team around the school to point out many of the deficiencies discussed in the meeting. The group highlighted the courtyard and its trees as one aspect of the campus that should be kept the same. The campus also has a Memorial Garden that should never change. The group highlighted the inadequacy of the teaching spaces and the limited collaboration/common spaces. There are not enough meeting spaces on campus. Certain teachers try to use the hallway space, but the lack of climate control makes this difficult. The acoustics of this large concrete space are very problematic. There are Educational Suitability Summary Report Bowie High School are not housed in adequate spaces and some are even using closets. There are four Life Skills units, and only two share access to an accessible toilet/shower. CTE spaces also require upgrades, and the wish list of programs includes a greenhouse for agriculture, broadcast or film program with connections to SXSW, an upgraded engineering space, and a more visitor-friendly entrance to the culinary dining space. It was also requested that the library be reimagined to reflect the current educational world and the learning spaces on campus do not facilitate or stimulate creativity or collaboration. They say they are achieving community despite many deficiencies in the building. There is not a large auditorium this should be a possibility, but in the past, they have held meetings off campus at the Wildflower Center or the Austin Public Library. While the upgrades to athletics and fine arts will alleviate some of the issues on campus, such as hosting programs out of portables, the environment. Assessment Findings The Educational Suitability Assessment of Bowie High School earne and places the campus in a category of Average. The assessment consists of seven General Building categories and eight Academic categories to determine areas that need unsatisfactory. Studios are generally undersized per Ed Spec. Casework storage is inadequate and inconsistent. Learning spaces need modernization, updated technology, more flexible furniture, and support for small group and individual breakout spaces to meet current Ed Spec standards. Life skills/special education do not have access to needed support spaces. is too small for student enrollment. There are opportunities to sit in large corridors and in courtyard, but dedicated cafeteria space is not adequate. Cafeteria flooring is tiered.

There is inadequate access to electrical outlets throughout studios. Administration Spaces for PTSA/visitors is close to the entry, but there is no transparency into the space. Satisfactory Outdoor courtyards and central courtyard could be used for outdoor learning if supported adequately with technology and comfortable, flexible furniture. Greenhouses are in poor condition and not functioning. There is no dedicated garden elsewhere on campus. Cracked concrete floors, and bats have been noted as issues. CTE and Career Connected campus. The high school offers almost all CTE programs, including a strong culinary arts program with supporting facilities. Some CTE courses are being taught in typical studios without is very satisfactory.

Crockett ECHS,55.0,52.0,1,1,"south Austin and is known for its career and technology programs. The school offers articulated classes and certifications for students so that they may graduate ready to enter the workforce. The automotive and construction programs are of particular interest, as each are in specialized courtyards wrapped by wide outdoor walkways. Although the campus takes pride in its outdoor spaces, updates to landscaping and furniture could increase opportunities for outdoor learning. Once you enter the studio wings around the central courtyard, the arrangement of typical studios is clustered in groups of six to eight. The studios are wrapped around a large group office, storage and other support spaces. In each pod, there are no collaboration or breakout areas that aid in flexible teaching. The building layout allows for the ability to reconfigure pods to provide breakout areas and other support spaces. Renovations would be required for the campus to align more closely with the new Educational Specifications. Athletics spaces are original and outdated. Locker facilities are in poor condition, have accessibility issues, and do not have hot water. The weight room, trainer and other support spaces are not properly sized to support current student enrollment. The athletics fields do not have lights, creating scheduling issues and safety concerns that prevent the school from hosting baseball, softball, track or soccer. Band spaces are too small and lack adequate storage. Various band programs take place in retrofitted rooms lacking the required acoustic performance. Significant upgrades will be required to bring these spaces up to the level of other AISD facilities and the new Educational Specifications. Interview Overview The interview with Principal Kori Crawford and other staff members was very productive due to the detailed preparation of the Crockett team. The team takes significant pride in their school and feels that with improvements to furniture and finishes, the school could attract more students. Community members and staff have expressed frustrations regarding equity between schools. Other high schools in the area have received renovations and additions, which they said has created a challenge for campus staff to show students and families the programs that are offered at Crockett High School. They said that the older, outdated aesthetic of the campus is hampering the public’s perception of the school. They also noted the athletics facilities as an important discussion point because these spaces are often the only impression that community members get of the school. Staff and students take pride in their facilities, but the existing condition makes it difficult to convey to the rest of the community. There is a desire for a complete replacement of the athletics wing, including an High School replacement gym. This replacement would include new locker facilities, a dedicated weight room and updated training facilities. The outdoor play fields need better access and lighting so that teams can practice, host events and have increased safety. Other needs include a dedicated maker space, dedicated storage space for performing arts programs, general building storage, and additional studios for expanding CTE programs. Licensing and student- to-instructor ratios for these specialized programs create scheduling issues. Assessment Findings The Educational Suitability Assessment of Crocket Early College High School earned a and places the campus in a category of Average. The assessment consists of seven General Building categories and eight Academic categories to determine areas that need more attention. Many spaces are missing blinds, or the blinds are in poor condition. Artificial lighting controls vary across campus but are predominately limited to one on/off switch. Some spaces do have alternating rows or lighting zones for slightly improved conditions. It appears that thermostats unsatisfactory. Traffic circulation for vehicular, bus and pedestrian traffic is not clearly noted. The bus drop-off loop shares an entrance and exit with two parking areas. Student parking stretches far from the main building. Sports field parking is undersized and often far from the fields. Additionally, building signage and wayfinding is present, but not conveniently located for optimal use. The fields are adequate in size but could be more appropriately located in relation to the school is aged, but adequately maintained. The arrangement of school spaces allows for convenient nighttime use of the school and the corridors are average width. A community room unsatisfactory. The furniture appears to be in satisfactory condition but does not allow for easy reconfiguration of the space for different learning groups. The principal expressed concern over the quantity and quality of furniture. Although it has all been recently acquired, the furniture does not meet the needs of a growing enrollment. Furniture replacement needs to occur to meet the utilize aged equipment and are insufficient to accommodate the enrollment. Support spaces such as locker rooms are undersized and aged and pose ADA compliance issues. Typical of high schools built during this time period, the locker rooms are compartmentalized and and quality varies throughout campus. The studios are typically served by a couple of computers that are dated or near the end of life. The number of data and power outlets serving a standard studio is adequate given the low demand. However, more specialized spaces (i.e., computer labs, CTE spaces, etc.) that demand power and data are underserved by existing area. Once you enter the suite, the reception area is dark and has no natural daylight. Noise travels easily from lobby to office spaces. The conference rooms are easily accessible but have Studio wings do not meet the intent of the new Education Specifications, but with renovations this would be achievable. Most studios and labs have the correct technology, but markerboards need upgrades. The special education space is adequately sized but needs cosmetic and High School upgrades. The main entrance to the space is accessed from the exterior of the building and provides an uncovered entrance for students with mobility impairments. Equipment (kitchen, lifts, changing tables, etc.) are past their life cycle and function poorly or not at all. the rankings in both main class space (band halls, choir, etc.) and storage and practice room spaces. Acoustics, lighting, insufficient storage, aged equipment and only a minimal number of practice spaces are among the primary concerns. Visual arts spaces are undersized and served courtyards throughout campus. Many of these courtyards offer shade. Improvements in maintenance and the addition of features (seating, elements of learning, etc.) would improve the usability of these spaces. Mosquitos are often an issue to staying in these spaces for extended although minimal in many cases. These small windows offer very little in terms of exterior views. The principal reports consistent issues with rodents (especially in the science wing), including ants, roaches, mosquitos and bees (predominately in courtyard spaces). CTE and Career cafeteria features a variety of seating types, the overall capacity of the seating space and satisfactory. The library offers space and flexibility for collaborative work of different group sizes. A variety of furniture types and groupings support social interaction and separation for areas of individual study. The library has adequate technological support.

Garza Independence,43.0,50.0,0,1,"year. LBJ ECHS will remain and undergo renovations to grow its Medical Sciences pathway. A large courtyard at the front of the building creates a welcoming and distinct entry. The campus has recently completed a long-range master plan that includes renovations of the existing academic wings, demolition of fine arts, and new construction of athletic and other support spaces. In general, the campus does not meet most of the new Educational Specifications. The quality of the artificial lighting and natural daylight in studio spaces is poor. Many of the learning spaces in the building (studios, media center, gyms, etc.) do not have access to natural light or exterior views. Windows are limited in size, and the amount of natural light is minimal. Acoustics are adequate with only slight sounds traveling between the corridor and adjacent studio spaces. Campus circulation does not allow for clear wayfinding, making navigation of the space difficult. The campus is planned to undergo partial renovations to the academic wing starting in April creating a more vibrant media center that meets the latest Educational Specifications. The renovations will also include medical science lab spaces, a community meeting room, and security features. In addition, the courtyard is being designed to be a space for outdoor learning. Existing outdoor sports fields, tennis courts and a full running track are in good condition and wellsecured by a perimeter fence. The indoor athletic spaces are aged and are planned to be moved to a new facility per the master plan. Interview Overview The interview for LBJ Early College High School was conducted with Principal Jon Bailey and various staff members. The front entry courtyard is important to the campus identity; it contains a large marble Texas monument, a student memorial, and seating that is used for outdoor learning. They also noted that the new medical sciences area functions well, but many of the other learning spaces are outdated and do not meet modern standards. Many programs on campus are not housed in appropriate spaces. The Fire Academy program does not have a dedicated space or adequate storage for equipment. The fine arts studios need to be updated, and the athletics wing is outdated and not appropriate for today’s schools. CTE courses take place in a basement with no daylight or views to the outside. The school would like to add more CTE programs, including does little to foster connectivity and creativity. Collaboration is a challenge due to lack of available meeting spaces. The school needs more flexible spaces that can accommodate different group sizes and have enough transparency to feel open and inviting. Additional lecture spaces of various sizes would be helpful for hosting guest speakers and events. Updated technology in the studios and social spaces is essential to keep up with changing teaching methods. Outdoor learning takes place at several loose picnic tables in the front courtyard and a small area near the bus drop-off. The school needs dedicated outdoor learning areas that are covered to protect students from weather. These spaces should also have access to technology, including power and data ports, so students can charge laptops and stay connected. Assessment Findings The Educational Suitability Assessment of LBJ and LASA high schools earned a and places the campus in a category of Average. The assessment consists of seven General Building categories and eight Academic categories to determine areas that need more unsatisfactory. Furniture throughout the school varies. Some science labs have received new furniture, but in general, furniture does not meet the intent of an easily reconfigurable space as indicated in the Educational Specifications. There are currently no collaboration spaces that unsatisfactory. Evidence of pests is seen both inside and out. The basement level has an odor of water penetration. Even if spaces have access to natural daylight, the amount of light is Controllability of systems varies from room to room. Most studios have thermostats, but users indicate that some thermostats are not working. Light switching varies from room to room, ranging from one switch for all lights and alternating row. No lights are dimmable. Some School Many spaces have an inadequate number of power and data outlets. The renovation project will address some of this, but future work will be needed to address all technological new Educational Specifications. The campus is subdivided by department and not per learning neighborhoods. Science labs are not configured per the Ed Spec and some science labs are smaller than standard studio spaces. No maker spaces or collaboration spaces were observed spaces need renovations or replacement. Locker rooms are aged, and restrooms in the space do not provide privacy for student athletes. The weight room is dated and not appropriately sized for the enrollment. Equipment has met life expectancy and will need to be replaced. loading occurs on the street and could be improved for student safety. Finding the front door can be a challenge if you have never been to the campus. The building lacks clear signage and wayfinding as well as . Shade is very limited on campus. There is limited visitor parking, and most ADA spaces are taken by staff before visitors arrive. The main entrance to the school is directly off a central courtyard that features stone seating, a variety of shade trees, multiple fully meet the current Educational Specifications. The Performing Arts Center is also dated and some natural daylight, but the space is dated. There are multiple types of seating but could use appearance of the school is dated and features a large courtyard at the public front. The arrangement of school spaces allows for nighttime use for public functions, but the public spaces are spread across opposite ends of the school. (The gym is opposite the library, which is on the second floor.) The interior circulation on campus is adequate, but wayfinding tends to be a challenge. The current building plan does not allow for ease of after-hours use, as it is difficult to lock down portions of the school. The renovations will allow for meeting spaces and allow for satisfactory. Although the campus has a large courtyard space, the space has not been fully developed to meet the intent of the Educational Specifications. There are outdoor tables, but they need to be configured to better suit teaching and learning. There are no active outdoor of the CTE spaces are in the basement level, which does not allow natural daylight to enter these spaces. These spaces need renovations.

Liberal Arts & Science Academy (LASA),53.0,63.0,1,1,"Suitability Summary Report Future Liberal Arts and Science Academy at Current Eastside College High School share a campus in east Austin. Together, they serve an enrollment of campus and the Liberal Arts and Science Academy (LASA) will begin occupying the campus in wayfinding signage is poor. While the campus is large with ample daylight and courtyards for outdoor learning, it needs renovations and modernizations to meet the current Educational Specifications. The primary campus building is one story with traditional double-loaded academic corridors and fullheight exterior windows that maximize natural light in the studios. There is no transparency between most studios and corridors and no room for collaboration or breakout space outside the studios. Most of the furniture and finishes are outdated and need updates to fully support a modern and collaborative learning environment. The athletic additions are undersized, difficult to navigate and need modernization. The campus is scheduled to school year. The renovations will consist of reconfiguring some academic studios, CTE rooms, and athletic spaces to functionally support the programs at LASA. Newly accommodated programs will include dance, guitar/jazz band, wood shop, metal shop, robotics, scitech, and additional science labs. The student parking lot on the north side of the building will be reconfigured and restriped to support marching band practice. Interview Overview The interview was conducted virtually with the future users of the campus, the Liberal Arts and Science Academy. We were joined by Principal Crescenzi along with select faculty and staff. While participants generally expressed the need for more space for their growing enrollment, they agreed there are some features of the campus that should be preserved. These features include the Veterans’ Memorial at the main entrance, the future College Center and the existing courtyards that provide access to daylight, views and outdoor learning opportunities. Participants also shared their concerns about the suitability of certain programmatic spaces. Both the main gymnasium and the Performing Arts Center are undersized, and neither can support wholecampus events. The campus has no dedicated marching pad, and the interior Report Future Liberal Arts and Science Academy support spaces are undersized for their robust music program. In the CTE and Fine Arts wing, the robotics room is limited by the low ceiling height. The wrestling room needs a dedicated practice area, and the weight room could be larger. Some teachers expressed concerns about the lack of flexible collaboration spaces throughout the campus. In the future, the school hopes to include programs such as music production, anthropology, animation production, biotech lab research, fire academy, marketing/business/accounting, and sports medicine. These programs need room to grow, and participants emphasized the lack of available interior space as a significant barrier to programmatic growth. Campus representatives shared their hope to create more permanent outdoor learning spaces in the exterior courtyards. Establishing strong network connections that support digital learning will be an important consideration for future campus planning. Assessment Findings The Educational Suitability Assessment of the future LASA campus at Average.

LBJ ECHS,59.0,71.0,1,2,"year. LBJ ECHS will remain and undergo renovations to grow its Medical Sciences pathway. A large courtyard at the front of the building creates a welcoming and distinct entry. The campus has recently completed a long-range master plan that includes renovations of the existing academic wings, demolition of fine arts, and new construction of athletic and other support spaces. In general, the campus does not meet most of the new Educational Specifications. The quality of the artificial lighting and natural daylight in studio spaces is poor. Many of the learning spaces in the building (studios, media center, gyms, etc.) do not have access to natural light or exterior views. Windows are limited in size, and the amount of natural light is minimal. Acoustics are adequate with only slight sounds traveling between the corridor and adjacent studio spaces. Campus circulation does not allow for clear wayfinding, making navigation of the space difficult. The campus is planned to undergo partial renovations to the academic wing starting in April creating a more vibrant media center that meets the latest Educational Specifications. The renovations will also include medical science lab spaces, a community meeting room, and security features. In addition, the courtyard is being designed to be a space for outdoor learning. Existing outdoor sports fields, tennis courts and a full running track are in good condition and wellsecured by a perimeter fence. The indoor athletic spaces are aged and are planned to be moved to a new facility per the master plan. Interview Overview The interview for LBJ Early College High School was conducted with Principal Jon Bailey and various staff members. The front entry courtyard is important to the campus identity; it contains a large marble Texas monument, a student memorial, and seating that is used for outdoor learning. They also noted that the new medical sciences area functions well, but many of the other learning spaces are outdated and do not meet modern standards. Many programs on campus are not housed in appropriate spaces. The Fire Academy program does not have a dedicated space or adequate storage for equipment. The fine arts studios need to be updated, and the athletics wing is outdated and not appropriate for today’s schools. CTE courses take place in a basement with no daylight or views to the outside. The school would like to add more CTE programs, including does little to foster connectivity and creativity. Collaboration is a challenge due to lack of available meeting spaces. The school needs more flexible spaces that can accommodate different group sizes and have enough transparency to feel open and inviting. Additional lecture spaces of various sizes would be helpful for hosting guest speakers and events. Updated technology in the studios and social spaces is essential to keep up with changing teaching methods. Outdoor learning takes place at several loose picnic tables in the front courtyard and a small area near the bus drop-off. The school needs dedicated outdoor learning areas that are covered to protect students from weather. These spaces should also have access to technology, including power and data ports, so students can charge laptops and stay connected. Assessment Findings The Educational Suitability Assessment of LBJ and LASA high schools earned a and places the campus in a category of Average. The assessment consists of seven General Building categories and eight Academic categories to determine areas that need more unsatisfactory. Furniture throughout the school varies. Some science labs have received new furniture, but in general, furniture does not meet the intent of an easily reconfigurable space as indicated in the Educational Specifications. There are currently no collaboration spaces that unsatisfactory. Evidence of pests is seen both inside and out. The basement level has an odor of water penetration. Even if spaces have access to natural daylight, the amount of light is Controllability of systems varies from room to room. Most studios have thermostats, but users indicate that some thermostats are not working. Light switching varies from room to room, ranging from one switch for all lights and alternating row. No lights are dimmable. Some School Many spaces have an inadequate number of power and data outlets. The renovation project will address some of this, but future work will be needed to address all technological new Educational Specifications. The campus is subdivided by department and not per learning neighborhoods. Science labs are not configured per the Ed Spec and some science labs are smaller than standard studio spaces.

Finding the front door can be a challenge if you have never been to the campus. The building lacks clear signage and wayfinding as well as . Shade is very limited on campus. There is limited visitor parking, and most ADA spaces are taken by staff before visitors arrive. The main entrance to the school is directly off a central courtyard that features stone seating, a variety of shade trees, multiple fully meet the current Educational Specifications. The Performing Arts Center is also dated and some natural daylight, but the space is dated. There are multiple types of seating but could use appearance of the school is dated and features a large courtyard at the public front. The arrangement of school spaces allows for nighttime use for public functions, but the public spaces are spread across opposite ends of the school. (The gym is opposite the library, which is on the second floor.) The interior circulation on campus is adequate, but wayfinding tends to be a challenge. The current building plan does not allow for ease of after-hours use, as it is difficult to lock down portions of the school. The renovations will allow for meeting spaces and allow for satisfactory. Although the campus has a large courtyard space, the space has not been fully developed to meet the intent of the Educational Specifications. There are outdoor tables, but they need to be configured to better suit teaching and learning. There are no active outdoor of the CTE spaces are in the basement level, which does not allow natural daylight to enter these spaces. These spaces need renovations.

McCallum High School,50.0,19.0,1,0,"Austin. The campus serves as AISD’s Fine Arts Academy and is open to all students in AISD who wish to attend, provided they are accepted through the admissions process. The original addition to the Fine Arts Academy, McCallum offers general education coursework and CTE programs including Engineering, Accounting, Animation, Commercial Photography, A/V Production, Graphic Design and Exercise Science. The school has a robust athletics department, and the current facility size is creating issues in holding/scheduling games, especially in the main gymnasium. The design of the original building provides access to daylight for all the exterior-facing studios, however the building lacks flexibility and does not allow for the types of spaces needed to teach classes at the current AISD standards. Studios are set up for rows of desks facing a single instructor and lack the infrastructure or flexible furniture to allow for a variety of seating arrangements. Interview Overview The interview was conducted via online conference call with Principal Nicole Griffith, Assistant Principal Gabe Reyes, Fine Arts Academy Director Heather Ramsay and Building Manager Camille Nix. Athletics Department Chair Tom Gammerdinger and CTE Department Chair Audrea Moyers joined to discuss conditions specific to their departments. McCallum High School has an important historical legacy, and there are artifacts that the school would like to display, including building exterior and in the courtyard. The interview highlighted many programs that are not in suitable spaces. McCallum is the designated Fine Arts magnet school for the district, yet two of its majors (guitar and piano) are housed in portables. There is no designated facility for the Arts Academy needs space to expand to increase its course offerings, including a dedicated drama scene shop, a dedicated computer lab, and dedicated studios for music theory, music history and art history. Athletics is a large area of concern. The competition gym spectator seating is inadequately sized and is located on one side of the gym, which creates problems when seating spectators from both schools together. They need to be able to run games concurrently to keep games from running too late, but the competition gym is the only gym with space for seating, and spectators for games in the practice gym end up standing against the walls. CTE is another large area of concern. All but one of the programs are in spaces of School and infrastructure. The campus currently offers programs in Business, Engineering, Accounting, Animation, Commercial Photography, A/V Production, Graphic Design and Exercise hindered by many aspects of the school’s infrastructure, including lack of collaboration space/flex space. The studios do not support any configuration but a lecture setup and there is no breakout space for group projects. The school also lacks teacher collaboration spaces (e.g., dedicated PLCs). Assessment Findings The Educational Suitability Assessment of McCallum High School and places the campus in a category of Unsatisfactory. The assessment consists of seven General Building categories and eight Academic categories to determine areas that need The cafeteria, gym and library cannot be accessed without allowing full school access, and there is no dedicated community meeting room.

Navarro ECHS,58.0,78.0,1,2,"north Austin, is a large campus offering a majority of the CTE programs that AISD offers. The school, there have been many stand-alone buildings constructed, including a science building, acres. Due to the network of stand-alone buildings, the campus feels open and has a collegiate atmosphere. Updates to the landscape could elevate the campus grounds and the overall impression of the school. The main building has a large, open-air courtyard and covered, exterior circulation between the studio clusters. Each studio cluster does not have visibility to the courtyard space. To make the exterior covered circulation space more utilized, furniture upgrades and power infrastructure are needed. The CTE programs use space throughout the present. Highlighting all the programs that the campus offers would increase visibility and knowledge of these programs for the students and visitors. The campus has many portables and hosts several programs from them, including special education and the Graduation Preparatory Academy at Navarro. Many years ago, portables were placed on one of the athletics practice fields, which led to the current shortage of practice fields for the campus. Interview Overview The interview took place on campus following the site assessment walk. Attendees included Principal Covin, Assistant Principal De La Cruz and Athletics Director Jacob Anderson. Interviewees expressed a large concern about the athletics facilities and in particular the condition of the sports fields. The conditions have caused athletes to become injured during practices and competitions due to uneven ground. The main field is particularly uneven and is not have irrigation, and it has been difficult to get grass established that will stand up to the wear and tear on a practice field. The school welcomes the community to use the track and field, but recently has had to prohibit use of the field to keep it in adequate condition for the sports teams. The athletics building is a maze of hallways and locker rooms and does not meet the needs of a students. The main gym does not have A/V, which is problematic for any game that the school hosts. The bleachers are old, and many times get out of adjustment and do not retract fully. The lockers in all locker rooms are so dated that the products and replacement parts have been discontinued, and as lockers break, they cannot be repaired. The coaches’ offices are cramped Early College High School all the coaches. The group requested more permanent, organized storage solutions for athletic programs. Currently, temporary solutions (Conex) are being utilized for athletic storage throughout the campus. There is a dedicated CTE building that houses many CTE programs. They requested that an industrial washer/dryer be provided. Many of the programs, such as welding, get clothing and aprons dirty. There is a residential washer/dryer, but the size and durability are inadequate. While the CTE rooms are generally in good working order, there are some places that need upgrades. There is insulation falling from the ceiling in for setting up outdoor studios and more flexible, collaborative spaces for students to learn outside of the traditional studio. The space is there, particularly in the wide outdoor circulation spaces of the main building, which face the courtyards and are protected from weather. The old lockers need to be removed, and better outdoor furniture and access to power and data are needed to make the spaces functional. All interviewees expressed pride in their school and the mission in educating and coaching students, and strategic upgrades, especially to athletics, would benefit the school greatly. Assessment Findings The Educational Suitability Assessment average. The assessment consists of seven General Building categories and eight Academic feet wide. The cafeteria and gym can be used after-hours and the general appearance of the lacking, and blinds are provided in windows but are in poor condition. Academics & Learning professional learning center or teacher workroom, but limited transparency makes them difficult to use. One of these spaces (out of eight) has been converted to a collaboration space (photo shown below).

Northeast ECHS,58.0,82.0,1,2,"northeast Austin. Formerly called Reagan High School, it was one of four schools renamed square feet of space. Northeast ECHS is one of seven Early College High Schools in the district that allow students the opportunity to graduate simultaneously with a high school diploma and an associate degree at no cost to the students. Northeast is also one of the district’s AVID (Advancement Via Individual Determination) schools, which support students who are traditionally underrepresented in higher education and prepares them for success in school and other postsecondary opportunities. Additionally, Northeast ECHS is one of four high schools in AISD that participates in Career Launch, which allows students to get a head start in a career approved for interior renovations for its Career Launch: Careers in Technology program in partnership with Dell. Interview Overview The interview with Principal Sterlin McGruder, an assistant principal and other staff members identified areas for improvement throughout the campus. The campus is large and spread out, composed of multiple buildings and a large amount of covered outdoor space. Much of the interview focused on the future and ways the Educational Specifications, they said that collaboration is not currently supported to the highest level. The campus’s “New Mall” supports collaboration better than other areas, but much of the remaining space does not allow for opportunities for informal collaboration. Outdoor learning areas are underutilized (despite an abundance of space) due to a lack of resources, e.g., power, teaching areas, furniture, etc. Amphitheater-type seating was suggested as a solution that could support a variety of teaching modalities. Performing arts spaces could use more storage and potentially an expansion. Orchestra was only recently added to the school’s program, so it Summary Report Northeast Early College High School supports school functions but could use new seating as the current seats are original and are not easily cleanable. The HVAC system is dated, and the campus experiences multiple outages per year. There are many areas for accessibility issues can lead to inequities across campus. Some restrooms do not have an accessible stall, and all restrooms have old, rusty sink fixtures that are not accessible. The drama studio has a sloped floor that prevents some students from accessing the entire room. The dressing rooms for the theater are only accessible by a set of stairs. The UIL sports held on campus are volleyball, basketball and wrestling; all others occur elsewhere. Outdoor sheds house much of the equipment for sports programs, but they are aging and need repair. A larger, centralized complex for equipment storage needs could be beneficial. The assistant principal and teachers expressed concerns about the fields not having proper irrigation. Since they are not properly irrigated, the grass dies. Then the fields are not usable after it rains, and they have become uneven and unsafe due to erosion. Replacing them with turf was brought up as a possible solution that requires less maintenance and would allow them to be used more consistently yearround. The athletics department is also in need of updated spaces (with a sink/kitchen and restroom); these are currently housed in dilapidated portables. Opportunities for outdoor sports instruction supported by technology are also on the wish list. In terms of technology around the campus, upgrades that will help support the future of learning through virtual reality, augmented reality, artificial intelligence, collaboration through the internet, and stronger computational power are items that the staff thinks should be present in every studio. The desire for the learning environment to work for the students and allow for fluidity in learning is of utmost importance to the staff. Overall, the staff, teachers and students have a lot of pride in their campus. It is not seen as a traditional high school, and renovations and upgrades would help support their future thinking development. Assessment Findings The Educational Suitability Assessment of Northeast High School places the campus in a category of Average. The assessment consists of seven General Building categories and eight Academic categories to can be accessed after-hours, but the cafeteria and library are too centralized to be used after-hours.

Travis ECHS,60.0,61.0,1,1,"with Graduation Preparatory Academy housed at this campus) in south Austin. The school’s purpose statement is to graduate all students prepared to be successful in any postsecondary construction. Parts of the school are two stories, and the athletic program is in a separate building behind the main campus. The track and practice fields are behind the athletic building. It is difficult to navigate the campus due to the multiple additions. The cafeteria is off the main entrance to the campus and has a stage. The auditorium is able to be accessed after-hours and is located toward the back of the main building. The auditorium is in good condition and has ample stage space. The studios have the connected desk/chair configuration, making reconfiguration a challenge. The studios appear small but have adequate artificial and natural lighting. The athletic building is located toward the back of the campus and was receiving roof work during our assessment. There are inadequacies in the small gym that does not allow for proper practice. The dance/cheerleading space is generous and has the appropriate supporting program spaces. The weight room is in an existing warehouse. It does not have proper ventilation, nor does it have the proper support programs such as restrooms and storage. Interview Overview This interview was held virtually, but on-site, and we were joined by Principal Hantgin and staff from a few departments. The attendees told us that Travis ECHS has a rich history and through the years has undergone changes that have both benefited and disadvantaged the campus. Their specialized CTE programs have become a model for other campuses across the district and the staff aims to keep Travis ECHS on the forefront of learning. The pieces of the campus that staff feel are important to the school’s image are the wood front doors, which are original to the building; the tower in the back, which was attached to the original boiler house; and the veterans memorial at the front of the campus. Many programs are not in suitable spaces, including those in portables or in disconnected buildings. Life skills and the Delta Lab are in portables, and the weight room is in a stand-alone building purchased from an auto shop. The athletics director voiced concern for the small size of the auxiliary gym as well as the lack of seating on both sides of the main competition gym. Their popular in a nonspecialized room that has been painted black to create a more realistic environment. The staff mentioned the need for large and flexible spaces for collaboration that have appropriate technology connections. Science labs need renovations to function properly as Travis Early College High School work (Bunsen burners, sinks, etc.), and the restrooms in the weight room do not work. Additional needed spaces include space for admin files, general storage areas, and dressing rooms for band and CTE programs. The principal talked about the wish of having an HVAC program on the campus. They do not currently have the proper turf facility for the athletics department and more seating in the main gym and lower competition fields. They would like to see collaboration spaces with flexible and adaptable furniture as well as technology connections. They would also like to have an on-campus swimming facility. Other requested updates to infrastructure include: an efficient HVAC system and more modern water fountains with bottle fill stations. Travis ECHS utilizes outdoor spaces for learning, but they do not have proper outdoor studios. Outdoor furniture, shade coverage and proper connections for technology would help create more engaging learning spaces.
